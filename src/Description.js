      <p>
        Until now, in my life, I change from active moments with a lot of variety, challenges and improvisations, to
        moments of tranquility and stability, being difficult to stay in a place during a long time. I consider myself a
        tolerant and respectful person with open mind and quite honest. I really like to listen people stories and
        backgrounds and their different experiences around the world.
